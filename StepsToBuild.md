To create your own version of a Perplexity AI, you can follow a structured approach utilizing open-source tools and models. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide:

## Overview of Perplexity AI

Perplexity AI is designed to combine the capabilities of search engines and AI chatbots, providing users with concise answers sourced from real-time web searches. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand queries and generate responses.

## Steps to Build Your Own Perplexity AI

### 1. **Choose an Open Source Model**

Select an appropriate open-source LLM that fits your computational resources. Some popular options include:
- **Mistral-7B**: A lightweight model suitable for initial searches.
- **Llama3-8B**: A more capable model for deeper queries.
- **Command-R**: Although not fully open-source, it is effective for complex prompts [1].

### 2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

You will need the following:
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **Libraries**: Install necessary libraries such as LangChain and others for managing LLMs and data retrieval.

```bash
pip install langchain
```

### 3. **Implement Function Calling**

To retrieve data from search engines, implement function calling. You can use:
- **vLLM**: Supports function calling compatible with OpenAI standards.
- **llama.cpp**: Has draft support for function calling [1].

### 4. **Design Your Prompting Strategy**

Decide between:
- **Single-turn Prompts**: Quick queries that yield immediate responses.
- **Multi-turn Prompts**: More complex interactions that maintain context over several exchanges [1].

### 5. **Integrate Data Retrieval Mechanisms**

Incorporate search capabilities to fetch current information:
- Use APIs from search engines or web scraping techniques to gather data.
- Structure your application to handle both real-time searches and cached responses efficiently.

### 6. **Optimize Performance with Mixed Models**

Utilize a combination of lighter and heavier models:
- Start with a lighter model for quick searches to reduce latency.
- Switch to a heavier model for detailed responses based on the initial search results [1].

### 7. **Testing and Iteration**

Conduct thorough testing:
- Evaluate the performance of your model with various types of queries.
- Refine prompts based on user feedback and interaction outcomes.

### 8. **Deployment**

Once satisfied with the performance, deploy your application locally or on a server:
- Use Docker for containerization if needed.
- Ensure that your deployment environment has sufficient resources (e.g., GPU support) [1].

## Additional Resources

For further learning, consider watching tutorials or reading guides on platforms like YouTube or Coursera, which provide step-by-step instructions on building AI applications and using specific libraries like LangGraph [3][5].

By following these steps, you can create a functional version of Perplexity AI tailored to your specific needs and preferences.
